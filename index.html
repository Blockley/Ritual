            <h1>City of Oxford Freemasonry</h1>
              <p>Blockley Lodge, No. 6345 in the register of the United Grand Lodge of England, is an Oxford based Freemasons’ lodge in the Masonic Province of&nbsp;Oxfordshire.</p> 
              <p>Our lodge is made up of members from all walks of life and backgrounds. We meet <strong>five times a year, on Saturdays</strong>, which we have found works well for students and younger professionals. We draw our membership from the City of Oxford, as well as across&nbsp;Oxfordshire.</p>
              <p>As a <strong> UGLE Universities Scheme Lodge</strong>, we are ideally suited for students, gradudates and staff of Oxford Brookes University and other tertiary education establishments. Our Saturday meeting format works well for people with busy weekday commitments. We welcome enquiries from anyone who is interested in&nbsp;Freemasonry.</p>

            <h2>What is Freemasonry</h2>
              <P>Freemasonry is one of the world’s oldest and largest non-religious, non-political, fraternal and charitable organisations. It teaches self-knowledge through participation in a progression of beautiful and occasionally dramatic ceremonies.  Brethren learn these by heart to perform within the Lodge.  The ritual follows ancient forms and uses the customs and tools of mediaeval stonemasons’ as allegorical&nbsp;guides.</P>
            
              <p>For Freemasons, there are four important values that help define their path through life: <strong>Integrity, Friendship, Respect</strong> and <strong>Service</strong>. In today’s world filled with uncertainty, these principles ring as true as they have at any point in the organisation’s&nbsp; history.</p>

              <h2>Our Lodge History</h2>
              <p>Blockley Lodge's own history began when it was granted a Warrant from the United Grand Lodge of England on 7 August 1946. However, it traces its masonic lineage in Oxford all the way back to Alfred Lodge No. 340 which was founded in 1814. The first meeting of Blockley Lodge was on the date of its consecration on 24 September 1946. In 2016 the Lodge joined the UGLE Universities Scheme with a princple focus on Oxford Brookes University. September 2021 saw the Blockley Lodge mark 75 years since its&nbsp; consecration. Today, we have a thriving lodge with many student and graduate members, as well as working and retired&nbsp;professionals.</p>
